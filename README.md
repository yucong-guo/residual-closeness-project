# residual-closeness-project

This project is based on the paper "Residual closeness in Network".

Fully implemented the algorithm discussed in the paper regarding the changes to the network after the removal of one node or one link.

By following the algorithm, this project further enhenced the algorithm about the changes to the network after the removal of two node or two link, along with fully implemented code.
